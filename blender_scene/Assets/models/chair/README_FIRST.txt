Foot Stool***

A highly detailed, but relatively simple, leather tufted hydrolic foot stool, offering a comfortable adornment to your arch/viz or character scenes.

The model is available as a native 3dsmax 2012 scene file (.max), and also in several scaled .obj formats, for importing easily into other applications, like Blender and Poser.  It comes complete with COLOR and BUMP maps for the leather tufted SEAT, and several distinct material groups for the other parts, like the base, handle, and wheels. Each part of the object is carefully UV unwrapped to provide minimal distortion in the textures.  There are no textures for the metal or plastic parts of the stool, but they ARE UV mapped if you wanted to make your own, but simple metal and plastic procedural materials work fine, and are recommended.

You are free to use or modify this object as you see fit, for use in your scenes as a scene filler or character prop, or any other type of situation where you may need a quality furniture item to render. This model can be used for both commercial and non commercial renders. You may not, however, resell this object, or any derivative of it; individually or as part of a package/set.

*** OBJ users: the POSER-specific OBJ version was exported with a scale conversion that should load with the appropriate scaling into Poser 9 and above. To ensure proper import into Poser, BE SURE to DE-select all check box options boxes in the Import Options dialogue. DESELECT the "Centered", "Place on Floor", "Percent of Standard Figure Size", etc. options in the import dialogue box after you select the poser .obj file, and then the object should load with correct scale into the scene.  In DAZ|STUDIO, simply choose the Poser-scaled .obj version, and import with Poser Preset option from the import dialogue box.  BLENDER users, obviously, choose the Blender scaled .obj.  All other software applications may be best suited to import the standard .obj file.

All textures were created by me, but most of the original reference textures were from CGTextures.com texture resource website, as well as other free texture repositories in some cases.

Have fun, and let me know if there are any issues:  luxxeon@zoho.com
